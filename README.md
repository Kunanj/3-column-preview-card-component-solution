## My process
firstly I created a parent-container, and then inside that container, I create 3 child-containers and put the respective images, headings, paragraphs and buttons. Then I gave them class names and styled them in css with respective colors and font styles. Then, here comes the main and best part of the design&coding. I gave the display:flex and flex-direction row and flex-wrap: wrap; to the parent-container. And to make it mobile responsive I changed the flex-direction:column and decresed some padding and that's all.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with flex properties. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
